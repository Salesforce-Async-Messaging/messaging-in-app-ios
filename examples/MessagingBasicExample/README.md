# Messaging for In-App iOS SDK: Simple UI SDK Example

A simple messaging app that uses the UI SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. Since this example uses the UI SDK, the basic user experience, including any pre-chat form fields, is handled by the SDK. To learn more about the UI SDK, see [Use the UI SDK for iOS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/service/messaging-in-app/guide/ios-ui-sdk.html).
