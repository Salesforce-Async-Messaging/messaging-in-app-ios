# Messaging for In-App SDK: iOS Examples

We provide the following example apps to demonstrate common uses for the Messaging for In-App SDK.

- [Simple UI SDK Example](./MessagingBasicExample/): A simple messaging app that uses the UI SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. The example uses the out-of-the-box UI provided by the UI SDK.
- [Simple Core SDK Example](./MessagingCoreExample/): A simple messaging app that uses the Core SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. This example creates a basic custom UI and accesses the lower-level Core SDK.
