# Messaging for In-App SDK: iOS Examples

We provide the following example apps to demonstrate common uses for the Messaging for In-App SDK.

- [Simple UI SDK Example](./MessagingBasicExample/): A simple messaging app that uses the UI SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. Since this example uses the UI SDK, the basic user experience, including any pre-chat form fields, is handled by the SDK. This example includes basic implementations for user verification, hidden pre-chat, and an auto-response component (such as a survey link). To learn more about the UI SDK, see [Use the UI SDK for iOS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/service/messaging-in-app/guide/ios-ui-sdk.html).
