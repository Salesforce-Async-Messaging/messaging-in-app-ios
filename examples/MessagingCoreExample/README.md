# Messaging for In-App iOS SDK: Simple Core SDK Example

A simple messaging app that uses the Core SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. In this example app, you can see how to create a conversation and get connected with an agent. This example includes basic implementations for user verification, hidden pre-chat, error handling, and an auto-response component (such as a survey link). Also included are some basic methods to retrieve all conversation entries, getting pre-chat fields from the remote config and submitting them, as well as how to enable console level debugging.

The UI for pre-chat hasnâ€™t been created in this example. If your deployment has pre-chat fields, you must handle that scenario in order to create a conversation.
