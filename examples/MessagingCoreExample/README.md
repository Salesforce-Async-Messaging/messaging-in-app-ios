# Messaging for In-App iOS SDK: Simple Core SDK Example

A simple messaging app that uses the Core SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. To get started, update the values that match your deployment in the MessagingViewModel.Swift createConversationClient method. UI for PreChat has not been created in this example, if your deployment has required PreChat fields you will need to handle these in order to create your conversation. In this example app you can see how to create a conversation and get connected with an agent. This example includes basic implementations for user verification, hidden pre-chat, error handling, and an auto-response component (such as a survey link). Also included are some basic methods to retrieve all conversation entries, getting PreChat fields from the remote config and submitting them, as well as how to enable console level debugging.
